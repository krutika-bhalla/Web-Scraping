<h1> Web-Scraping </h1>
Web-Scraping using a python module BeautifulSoup. 

1) The file name.py returns the links of searched item from the web page (bing in this case). It also renders back the Summary and Title of the link.

2) The file images.py downloads images of the searched items from the web page (bing). It also creates directories based on the name of the items searched. Once all possible images of the first item are downloaded, it immediately prompts the user to enter the next item of search and creates a new directory by that name.
